<p><strong>Min Time</strong> is a countdown app. It's main goal is to help you structure your talks and presentations. It divides the talk time into three phases: green, yellow and red. With a glimpse you get an idea how much time is left.</p>
<p>For example, a 70 minutes talk could be divided into 50, 15 and 5 minute segments. Once started, <strong>Min Time</strong> counts down from 70 to 0, changing colors and vibrating when a new phase is reached. During presentation you can switch to other apps. The app is intentionally kept simple. Just a few taps and you are ready to give your talk. To finish your presentations and tasks just in time.
